# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Workshop

Welcome to the **Personal Portfolio Workshop**!  
In this session, you’ll learn how to build and publish your own portfolio website using **Lovable.dev**, **GitHub**, and **VS Code**.

Follow the steps below carefully — everything you need is right here 💪  

---

## 🧩 Step 1: Download Node.js
Node.js helps you run JavaScript tools for your project.

👉 **Download here:** [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

**Example:**  
> Download the “LTS” version (recommended for most users).  
> Once installed, open your terminal and type:
> ```bash
> node -v
> ```
> You should see something like `v20.18.0`

---

## 💻 Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
VS Code is the main editor you’ll use to modify your project.

👉 **Download here:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

**Example:**  
> After installing, open VS Code and click **"New File"** to try writing:  
> ```javascript
> console.log("Hello World!");
> ```

---

## 🐙 Step 3: Register a GitHub Account
GitHub is where you’ll store and share your code.

👉 **Sign up here:** [https://github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)

**Example:**  
> Use your real name and school email if possible.  
> Username idea: `janedoe-portfolio`  
> Once signed up, visit your profile at: `https://github.com/<your-username>`

## 💖 Step 4: Visit Lovable.dev
Lovable is an AI-powered website builder that connects with GitHub.

👉 **Go to:** [https://lovable.dev/](https://lovable.dev/)

**Example:**  
> Click **“Sign in with GitHub”**.  
> Allow the permissions when asked (this lets Lovable save your website to your GitHub account).

## 🌐 Step 5: Create Your Personal Portfolio
On Lovable, start a new project and describe yourself.

🪄 **Fill in the details:**
> I am **[role]**, my name is **[first name] [last name]**, I study at **[university name]**.  
> Introduction: **[describe yourself shortly]**  
> I want my website to have a **[theme]** theme with animation.

Click **Generate** and let the magic happen! ✨

## 🚀 Step 6: Publish Your Website
After previewing your design, click **Publish** inside Lovable.

**Example:**  
> You’ll get a link like  
> `https://[yourname].lovable.app`  
> Share it with your friends or on social media!

## 🔄 Step 7: Sync Lovable Code to GitHub
Lovable automatically connects to your GitHub account.

**Example:**  
> Once published, go to your GitHub profile — you’ll see a new repository like:  
> `https://github.com/[your-username]/[project-name]`

## 💾 Step 8: Download the Code from GitHub
You can download the project to explore or edit it in VS Code.

**Example:**  
> On your GitHub repository, click the **“Code”** (green button) → **“Download ZIP”**,  
> then extract it to your computer.

## 🧠 Step 9: Open in VS Code and Install GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot helps you write code faster using AI.

**Example:**  
> In VS Code, open the Extensions tab (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for **“GitHub Copilot”**,  
> and click **Install**.  
> Then sign in with your GitHub account.

---

## ✨ Step 10: Use GitHub Copilot (Freestyle)

**Example Prompts:**
> - “Add a smooth scrolling effect between sections”  
> - “Change background color to match my theme”  
> - “Write a short introduction paragraph about me”

Just type your ideas — Copilot will suggest code instantly 💬
